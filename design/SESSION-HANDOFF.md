# Nova OS — Session Handoff

**Read this first, every session.** `CLAUDE.md` carries the doctrine (what Nova
is, the non-negotiables, where things live). Memory files carry durable
project facts. *This* file carries the live state of the work: what is
half-finished, what was decided and why, what is verified versus assumed, and
which dead ends are already closed.

Updated at the close of each session (`/nova-close`). Newest state on top;
the session log at the foot is append-only.

## CURRENT HANDOFF

**5 SEP — THE DELEGATION LOOP, THE EXERCISE ATLAS, THE AUDIT'S FIXES AND ITS
FIRST MOCKUPS ARE ALL SHIPPED AND VERIFIED LIVE. One thing is unproven (a plan
has never RUN), one is honestly empty (Carter Extension has no form video),
and three need his phone in his hand.**

GOAL (this session, 4–5 Sep): (1) the UI audit and its unambiguous fixes;
(2) Nova as chief of staff — chat as the front door, a capability registry,
multi-step plans; (3) the Lyfta-style exercise library — anatomy, cues, form
videos with timecodes, a 3D figure; (4) his picks from the audit mockups.

DONE CRITERIA — all MET, each verified in the browser at 375×812 on his real
data and confirmed live by `scripts/verify-shipped.mjs --server`:
- Audit fixes: notification width, clamped titles (also at the WRITE site in
  inbox.js), protein chart verdict + today excluded, absence states across all
  THREE vitals renderers, calendar dedupe, blank-screen fallback, filing ladder
  collapsed, Plan Today's JSON salvage, stale-error reaper, local dates.
- Phases 1–4 of `design/` "Nova as Chief of Staff": chat routes to job lanes
  (watch/weave/study/research/book/code) with an announce+undo strip;
  `lib/capabilities.js` is the three-way contract (router ↔ route ↔ registry,
  tested); `lib/plan.js` + `lib/planner.js` propose, validate (his-language
  refusals), schedule in waves, run, report; Phase 4 removed the Inbox lane
  buttons, folded the palette into the chat (⌘K/✦ ASK open Voice; route chip
  on the composer), thinned the ingest modal.
- Exercise atlas: `lib/muscles.js` (18-region closed vocabulary),
  `lib/data/exerciseAtlas.js` (135/135 anatomy+equipment), `exerciseCues.js`
  (135/135 seeds, HIS vault cues win), `src/BodyMap.jsx` (2D, animated by 17
  movement patterns), `src/Body3D.jsx` (three.js, lazy 512K chunk, same
  patterns as joint angles), `lib/exerciseVideos.js` (free yt-dlp search,
  timecodes via chapters, daily fill job with granted autonomy).
- Mockups he picked: A1 deck (Inbox), C2 one thing + C3 record moment + B1
  rings (Mission Control) — built into BOTH `MissionControl.jsx` and
  `MissionStructured.jsx`; his phone renders the STRUCTURED one.
- The exercise card is reachable from Train (`src/ExerciseSheet.jsx`,
  `POST /api/panel`): long-press a library row, or tap a name on Today's card.

STATE (HEAD `fff89ae`; last verified-live stamp `9ed8e5d`; the sheet
commit was deploying at close — check `gh run list --limit 1`):
- Vault: 134/135 exercises carry a resourceUrl (19 deep-linked `&t=`);
  Fitness Goals has equipment + limitations; `Wiki/Profile.md` STILL MISSING.
- Server: `startVideoScheduler` runs daily, first pass 60 min after boot,
  registered on the Guardian roster as `exercise-videos` (26h).
- Suite 1059 green — RUN IT UNDER `TZ=UTC` (the deploy's zone) before
  pushing; see DO NOT.

DECISIONS (his, 4–5 Sep):
- Chat stays a conversation; routing invisible until it matters; a job lane
  announces + offers JUST ANSWER IT rather than asking first.
- A PLAN never runs without showing him: proposed → his approve → run.
  Ceiling $6 / 6 steps (I first said $3; the real per-lane ceilings summed his
  own example to $5). Coach and Claude Code are reachable but never delegated.
- Form videos: the daily job may WRITE links unasked (a link cannot corrupt,
  backed up, undoable) — the one lane with granted autonomy; the reasoning
  lives in exerciseVideos.js so it is not read as precedent.
- Pulse budget stays $0.50: the 8-search cap already fixed it ($0.20–0.29/run).
- A1 now, A3 later; C2+B1 for a fortnight before deciding C1.

VERIFIED (this session, with locators): every item above was exercised on
the running app — see the commit bodies from `e91eac2` to `fff89ae`.

ASSUMED:
- A plan runs end to end (dispatch → await → report). Proposal/validation/
  scheduling are proven; `runPlan` has never executed on his account (~$4).
- The name-tap path on Today's card (no plan rows were rendered when checked).
- The Leader's daily card stays on-domain (two good scheduled runs seen).

OPEN — HIS:
- RUN A PLAN (the one unproven loop). Approve one in the Inbox.
- `Wiki/Profile.md` — four answers; the planner reasons without it.
- Hand-pick a Carter Extension video (the search cannot find one that names
  the movement; the rule is right to refuse).
- KEEP REMINDING (his instruction 5 Sep, logged in memory
  `nova-open-threads`): live cockpit mid-session on his phone; Telegram photo
  + voice from his phone; Scriptable widget re-paste.
OPEN — MINE, when asked: deck footer says SWIPE RIGHT even on a model-choice
card (no right swipe); protein ring at 0% shows no colour; A3 after a few
plans; C1's fold beneath C2 after a fortnight.

DO NOT:
- Do not write a test that assumes his timezone. `localDate.test.js` built
  dates from "+10:00" strings and asserted the Melbourne answer; GitHub's UTC
  runner failed it and FIVE deploys silently died — he noticed before I did.
  Build test dates from LOCAL components; run `TZ=UTC npm test` before push.
- Do not edit one Mission Control renderer and call it done: his phone draws
  `MissionStructured.jsx` (novaStyle 'cupertino'); `MissionControl.jsx` is the
  other layout; the vitals tile also lives in `AppleLayout.jsx`. Three
  renderers bit twice today. Check the DOM's Group labels ("Vitals") to know
  which is mounted — and match case-insensitively; "Body" matched "Upper Body".
- Do not let one shared word match a form video: "Carter" matched a bandsaw
  setup guide. A title must name the MOVEMENT (stem of the last word) or share
  two words — `titleIsAboutThisLift`, applied at every pick.
- Do not run yt-dlp searches back to back with a short timeout: 19 "misses"
  were throttle timeouts, not absences. 90s window + 1.5s pause, and keep
  "nothing found" separate from "never came back".
- Do not read `curl --max-time 5` failing as the server being down: the Mac
  was at load 91 from Chrome renderers (my own devtools pages among them).
  Check `uptime` and `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` before touching the service.
- Do not bind test stubs to 4199 — it is his live Kokoro sidecar's port.
- Do not tell the planner its CLI budget: it read `--max-budget-usd 0.5` as
  the money available for the work and refused his example.
- Do not mount `intentRouter` with the Vault OBJECT — every lane spawns with
  `cwd: vaultPath` and needs the string.
- Do not `git add -A` a half-built feature when pushing an urgent fix; use a
  targeted add (the deploy unblock was pushed alone this way).
- Earlier DO NOTs (3 Sep) all still stand.

## SESSION LOG (append-only, newest first)

### 4–5 September 2026 — the delegation loop, the exercise atlas, the audit's fixes and its first mockups

Twenty-one commits, `7cd9e16`→`fff89ae`. In order: the brief-audio replay bar;
the notification-width fix; the exercise atlas and animated figure; the UI
audit (artifact) and its unambiguous fixes; the chief-of-staff plan (artifact)
and Phases 1–4; Plan Today's JSON salvage and the stale-error reaper; form
cues; local dates; form videos found free (not $105) with timecodes and a
daily fill job; the 3D figure; the bandsaw rule; A1/C2/C3/B1; the exercise
sheet on Train. Two things he caught that I had not: five deploys had died on
my timezone-bound test, and the 3D figure existed only as a chat panel. Both
fixed the same day. The full per-commit reasoning is in the commit bodies.

### 3 September 2026 — the audit's last roster items, and the Leader learning to talk about his team
Finished #18 — every §6 item across all 66 reports is now shipped, met by
another item, or deferred with a reason, and the 547-line per-item record
moved out of the handoff into
`design/audits/2026-08-full-audit/00-COMPLETION-RECORD.md`. Shipped [37]–[46]
plus the surfaces [47]–[66] in five batches: the Leader's resumed-turn live
line and HEAD-checked research links, the pulse's novelty memory and named
cap, the evening brief warm, old-month health-mirror corrections, late-fire
reminder honesty, Todoist telling a deleted task from a completed one (gate
opened by probing his real account with two scratch tasks), the overnight
queue's one retry and late-landing reconcile, Ops match-lines for the study
lane and Scout, the Money list cap, chip ages and mark-handled on the Leader
screen, and the Ambient wall's sync age, stale dimming and OLED drift.

Three things were corrected rather than added. The pulse lane had been
failing 1–2 of 3 topics most nights since roughly 20 August, logging only
"exited 1"; one measured run showed the real cause — $1.06 of searching
against a $0.50 cap — so failures are now legible with cost receipts and the
prompt caps searching at 8, while the budget itself was left as his decision
rather than quietly raised. The plan's DONE/SKIP marks were recorded here as
unbuilt; they were not, and a live run over the real HTTP route proved the
whole loop including both consumers, so the handoff was wrong, not the code.
And the phone-width pass found three real defects that code review had not:
a satellite sitting across the core's status label, a 26×11px CLEAR control
on the action he takes four times a day, and a concept card wearing the daily
review's name.

Then his own three asks. He screenshotted the Leader saying "Budget Your
Stress Like Your Sets" and named the problem exactly: that is not managing,
leading, inspiring or directing a team. Measuring the corpus against his real
127-page shelf showed six of seventeen "leadership" matches were body pages —
"Manage" admitting Stress Management and Waist Management, "Frame" admitting
The X-Frame & High-Value Aesthetic Muscles — while the daily idea was
separately being handed a fleet block that is almost entirely training and
nutrition. Fixed at all three levels, and verified by regenerating the card,
which now reads "Delegate The Decision, Not Just The Task". Built the
exercise-targets preview he asked for, so today's card names the muscles and
expands to every lift before BEGIN SESSION. One durable trap learned: the
devtools browser's clock runs hours behind his, which sent me chasing a
training schedule that had never changed.

### 30 August – 2 September 2026 — the full-platform audit, and shipping its top findings
Audited all 66 agents and surfaces read-only, one per turn, then executed the
synthesis in tier order. The audit's own headline finding got worse on
contact: `--allowedTools` is not enforced under bypassPermissions, and where
the item-by-item read had found three unguarded spawn sites, a mechanical
sweep found fourteen — seven of them passing `--allowedTools ''`, meaning "no
tools please", while the model could in fact write files and run shell. Fixed
by denying the complement of what each lane asks for, so the allow-list is
enforced by construction. Proved with a canary after the obvious check —
asking the model to list its tools — returned two contradictory answers a
minute apart, one naming "PowerShell"; that method note is now in the module,
because it is the sort of thing that gets re-learned expensively.

Then Tier 1. The workout save was replaying through the offline outbox and
filing a second session — double-counting exercise state and re-firing the PR
ping and the Coach debrief — now idempotent on a client-stamped key, with the
PR celebration still returned on a replay since a lost response means he never
saw it. Health Insight was retrying an uncapped $0.50 compose every hour from
06:00 to midnight whenever it failed, silently; capped at three, with the last
failure announcing itself, and the lane got its first test file. Guardian was
watching 13 loops beside a roster of 29, so sixteen agents could die
unnoticed; it now derives the watch from the roster — verified live at 29 —
and five weekly agents whose exact-day windows a sleeping Mac could miss now
stay open for the rest of their cycle.

Corrected rather than added: a health-mirror test asserted a row for the 2nd
of the current month, which the page builder correctly drops as future — so it
failed every 1st, and had already broken two Pages deploys that day before it
was noticed. The deploy pipeline, not just the test, was the casualty. Suite
went 713-with-one-failing to 727 green.

### 27–30 August 2026 — the black screen, the ambush sheet, the once-a-day brief, an ingest cap that ate a job, and food macros that compute instead of recall
Four real failures, fixed in two commits. The black screen and the ambush
review sheet turned out to share one root cause: boot-resume trusted a
job's status from the server's list without loading its preview, so
`IngestReview` rendered a "ready" branch against null and threw, taking the
whole app down — reproduced at phone size before touching anything. Open
work now surfaces in the WORKING panel instead of seizing the screen, and
the same load-before-render ordering that fixes the ambush also fixes the
crash. The brief was marking itself "delivered" only when audio actually
played, but an auto-brief has no user gesture behind it, so iOS blocked
autoplay almost every time and the retry re-read the whole brief on every
open — now marks on delivery, server-side, shared across devices.

Then two complaints in one message. A vault-ingest video hit a $3 cost cap
— sized for a pasted note, applied indiscriminately to full weaves — spent
$3.08, and was killed with nothing written; raised both budget constants to
env-overridable backstops (25/40) reframed explicitly as guards against a
runaway loop, not spending controls. And food-macro logging gave two
different totals for the identical pizza description (1050 kcal/50g, then
940/36g) — traced to the prompt telling the model to answer "from your own
knowledge, no search" for most foods, which guarantees a different
plausible number every time since LLMs don't recall numbers reliably.
Rebuilt along the platform's own line: the model now only decomposes food
into components with gram weights; a new `nutritionFacts.js` looks each up
in USDA FoodData Central, scales by weight, and derives kcal from the
Atwater factors, so a stated kcal that disagrees with its own macros is now
impossible by construction. Verified live: the same pizza returned
identical totals (2,408 kcal/129g protein) across repeat calls, all four
components matched and source-attributed. While confirming no jobs were
in-flight before this session's own restart, found that a PRIOR restart had
in fact orphaned an in-progress job — his Atomic Habits ingest — which
directly answers, in the negative, the previous handoff's open question
about whether it ever completed. 709/709, lint 0, build green both times.

### 25–26 August 2026 — evidence on screen, the phone-voice bugs, the ship-verification crisis, and Coach reading his own notes
Started from his complaint that Nova speaks a lot without anything to look
at, and ended up rebuilding how "done" gets claimed at all. Made every
spoken Ask-Nova/Coach answer infer a visual panel deterministically (code
picks the shape from the question, never the model), added a `sessions`
panel that didn't exist, and wrapped every render site in an error boundary
— there was none anywhere in the app, so one malformed panel used to blank
the whole screen. He sent screen recordings of the phone voice failing;
watching them frame-by-frame (rather than guessing) found three separate,
unrelated bugs: the brief racing a TTS-status fetch and giving up silently,
a full-screen focus blur spotlighting a card rendered below the mobile
fold, and the iOS-audio "unlock" replaying his last sentence because its
audio element still held the previous TTS blob. Built findings-as-charts
(fuel findings had never exposed the numbers their prose quoted) and a
question-by-question brief close that reuses the existing inbox
approve/discard rails rather than inventing a new one. Let Coach apply
program edits from inside the chat — the write path already existed and
was tested, it just had nowhere to say yes from.

Then he said, plainly, that he no longer trusted "shipped" as a word from
me, and he was right to: nine commits had sat unpushed behind a blocked
permission classifier while progress kept being reported, a feature landed
in the one Coach-message renderer out of three that he wasn't looking at
(twice), and his PWA was silently serving a cached bundle for days because
`autoUpdate` updates the service worker, not the running app. Built the
actual failsafe rather than apologising again: a build id compiled from
the git commit (not a timestamp — those can't equal themselves across a CI
rebuild), a `version.json` the app polls and shows an UPDATE banner
against, and `scripts/verify-shipped.mjs`, which checks the LIVE deployed
bundle rather than the working tree. Running it immediately caught two
bugs in itself — a build id that could never match, and chunk names read
from local files that 404 against CI's different content hashes — which
is exactly the point of a script instead of a claim.

Closed by confirming, and it was true: Coach's progression engine, its
weekly detectors, the program audit and the Sunday debrief all ignored his
per-exercise session notes. A note reading "struggling to move 9.1kg
without a nudge of body momentum" could not stop a load increase, because
nothing except the chat ever read it. Built a narrow, suppress-only note
reader (a signal can hold a load increase, never create one) and wired it
through every surface that reviews his training — verified live: Cable
Lateral Raise and Alternate Incline Dumbbell Curl are now held, citing his
own sentences.

### 23–24 August 2026 — Phase C, the Librarian + Library, Coach that edits and judges the plan, and Fuel fixes he asked for twice
Finished the fluidity plan: writes now tag which slices they touched, so a
todo checkbox costs 3KB instead of 996KB (measured live). Two bugs only the
browser found — routes fire their own domain broadcast beside the chokepoint
one, which silently cancelled the whole optimisation, and one write emitting
two events made it sync twice. Built the Librarian (a book title + author →
triangulated dossier → woven vault pages, provenance-labelled researched vs
read) and the visual Library shelf with real Open Library jackets cached
server-side. Coach can now APPLY its suggestions to the real program through
typed ops with full undo, always behind a confirm sheet with a free-text box;
applied two changes to his live plan while he was at the gym. Then he pushed
back that Coach was "suggesting changes for the sake of them" — his data
proved it: 227 working sets, all RPE-rated, 88% at RPE 9–10, and the default
progression path never read RPE at all, so a shoulder press he was grinding at
RPE 10 kept earning +2.5kg. Effort now gates load everywhere and grinding
lifts get a tempo/control prescription instead of a number.

CORRECTED RATHER THAN ADDED: the "HARD SETS THIS WEEK" bar was showing LAST
week's numbers every Monday. A health-push failure that looked like my deploy
was actually one missing HealthKit metric making the whole JSON body invalid —
one absent reading was discarding every other metric. My first "too many
exercises" detector measured session length and could never fire, because he
already splits routines across days; the real signal (routines he cannot
finish) was in the same data. Copy that told him to earn FEWER reps than he
was already doing, and a proposal to cut Weighted Pull-Up 30 minutes after
Coach created it — both caught by running detectors against his real log
before shipping. And a CSS bug I introduced: adding the camera button pushed
the tweak panel's ASK button outside its card at phone width, which he found
after I called the feature live, because I had only screenshotted it at
desktop width.

### 23 August 2026 — model-cost fix, Coach's self-review, a shipped crash caught and fixed
He caught Coach hitting a "Fable 5 usage" limit mid-conversation — traced
to every unpinned Claude CLI call inheriting the account's ambient
default model, which had silently become Fable 5. Pinned Coach to opus
and 12 other automated background lanes to sonnet. Built the Coach's
program review (server/lib/coachProgramReview.js): three code-driven
detectors — a lift's name contradicting its filed muscle group, a lift
flat for 3+ weeks (swap suggested to the same muscle), a goal muscle
chronically under target — raised onto the inbox rails, surfaced in the
morning brief, the Train TODAY card, and Coach's own conversation
context, nudged at 3 and 7 days then escalated to Telegram. Verified
against his real vault: raised two genuine findings (a real Face Pull
mapping error, a real stale Cable Flys swap) that are still sitting in
his Inbox, intentionally. Added coach-chat auto-scroll-to-bottom and a
temporary mid-session exercise add ("this session only", never written
to the program) — but the first ship of the latter crashed his screen
black. Reproduced it properly on an isolated scratch server (a COPY of
his vault, throwaway port/data dir, his live backend untouched) rather
than guessing: found an undefined `${M}` font reference that only threw
at render time, plus a second bug where creating a brand-new exercise
mid-session was silently routed to the wrong destination (or worse, into
his real program if a routine happened to be open behind it). Both
fixed and re-verified on the same scratch repro. Also discovered and
fixed, mid-session, a real data-loss mechanism in inboxStore.js: writing
to it from a one-off script while the live server also runs risks a
silent cross-process cache clobber — the two coach findings vanished
once before I caught it and built the proper HTTP-route fix. 415/415
tests, four deploys, every bundle hash-verified.

### 18 August 2026 — mockup parity shipped + the audit that caught a live bug
P2 cockpit + one-bar log screen-verified and deployed. Visual-claims audit:
voice dynamics and canvas panels both proven real on screen; the audit
surfaced a genuine reply-loss bug (SW-update reload mid-speech ate the
answer) — fixed the same hour. Fuel cross-reference agent (spec #11)
built end-to-end with a true first finding on his real data; decline-asks-
why shipped on all Coach advice. 348/348 tests. Three deploys, every
bundle hash-verified against the harness-verified dist.

### 13–16 August 2026 — the Forge, the spoken lane made fast, and two wrong diagnoses
He sent an Instagram reel — a hand-built watchOS app dispatching Claude and
Codex jobs from the wrist, with live status in the Mac's notch — and asked
for the same, expanded. Watched it frame by frame (60 frames + Whisper
transcript) and wrote `design/WRIST-PLAN.md`: the key finding was that Nova
already owns most of what that author built from scratch (server, auth,
inbox rails, agent lights, SSE, Siri dispatch), so the genuinely new pieces
are a job runner, a notch HUD, and wrist dispatch. Built Phase 1, **the
Forge** (`lib/forge.js`): one spoken sentence → a real running artifact,
sandboxed to `~/NovaForge/`, live tool status on the existing rails,
persisted receipts, stop, and Telegram announcements including failures.
Verified with a real snake game — $0.90, 3m32s, 22KB self-contained HTML
that the job smoke-tested itself. Two bugs were mine and are recorded: the
plan's invented "Build" department (no such thing — Platform), and a
`stopForge` that mutated a disk copy so the stop flag never reached the
child.

The bigger thread was his complaint that Ask Nova from the watch felt so
slow it defeated the point. That was measurable, not a feeling — 14.2s,
15.9s, 23.9s sat in the request log. Cause: `/ask/sync` minted a NEW
conversation per ask, paying context assembly, a cold CLI boot, and prompt
cache creation every single time, because the warm pool is keyed by session
id and a fresh id can never hit it. `lib/spokenSession.js` now keeps one
conversation with day/age/turn caps and re-states the volatile numbers per
turn: **2.1–2.2s resumed, 11.5s cold**.

Then he said Siri still wasn't answering, and I got it wrong twice. First I
found and fixed a real bug — the keepalive drip prefixing the JSON body with
spaces, which Shortcuts could not parse — and reported it as the cause. It
was not; it had only ever affected slow answers, and my post-fix tests all
returned in 2s and looked clean. He said it still failed, so I added a raw-
body receipt, and that finally showed the truth: his Shortcut had been
sending the literal words `"Provided Input"` — the variable's NAME instead
of its value. One screenshot from him confirmed it in seconds. He rebound
the variable and it now works from his phone (`"8,538 steps on August 15th,
sir."`). The server now refuses known Shortcuts variable names out loud
rather than politely asking him a question he cannot answer hands-free. Also
untracked a PDF that a careless `git add -A` swept into a commit.

### 13 August 2026 — alarm-stop confirmed live; steps-parity thread opened and paused
The alarm-stop automation fired for the first time, cleanly, at 07:25 local
— filed 12 Aug's full health payload, `stepsComplete: true`, no errors. The
whole point of the prior close's fix, proven. He noticed Nova's steps
(10,022) sat ~1.1% under Apple Health's own figure (10,139) and asked why.
Root cause, confirmed against Apple's own developer forums: the true
cross-source dedup Health shows requires `HKStatisticsQuery`, a native
HealthKit API a Shortcut cannot call — Nova's per-device MAX fold is an
honest approximation, not a bug, and this project already proved the naive
alternative (no Source filter) is worse. Built a full adapter
(`lib/autoExport.js`, route `POST /api/health-data/auto-export`) for Health
Auto Export, a real app that CAN call the proper API, reusing the existing
shared ingest gate via a new `skipDateShift` option. Gate-clean (294/294
tests), live-tested with synthetic data, committed and pushed
(`84cadb5`) — but he then found the app wants a paid subscription and
declined to buy it right now. **Thread is parked, not abandoned**: the
adapter is built and waiting, untested against a real payload, for whenever
he decides to revisit it.

### 12 August 2026 (afternoon) — closing the health thread's last gap
He added the alarm-stop trigger on his phone — the previous close's fix is
now live end to end, pending tomorrow morning's first real run. Re-verifying
the previous handoff's claims by a second route (reading the pushlog and the
JSON files directly, not trusting the prose) surfaced a live bug it hadn't
caught: `server/data/health/2026-08-12.json` was carrying 11 Aug's
`activeEnergyKcal`, `walkingRunningDistanceKm`, `restingHeartRate`, `hrv`,
and `vo2Max` — 819 kcal and 15 km logged against 163 real steps. Cause: a
drill push made during the health thread's own testing used the literal
date `2026-08-12` instead of `yesterday`, landed as the day's first push
(so even the steps guard had nothing to compare against), and the other
accumulators had no guard at all — only steps did. Fixed by generalizing
`shouldDropLowerSteps` → `shouldDropLowerReading`, applied across a new
`ACCUMULATOR_METRICS` set (steps, activeEnergyKcal, walkingRunningDistanceKm,
sleep*); point-in-time metrics (RHR, HRV, VO2 max, weight) stay unguarded on
purpose since a later reading of those is just more current. Verified live
against the running server with a scratch date, not just unit tests. Today's
file repaired by hand. Gates re-run clean (287/287); committed, pushed
(`6b8751b`), service reloaded.

### 11–12 August 2026 — the health thread (concurrent session)
The steps saga ended, and not where anyone was looking. Three faults were
stacked: iOS **encrypts Health data while the phone is locked**, so the
00:05 automation had only ever succeeded on nights he happened to be
awake; my own monotonic-steps guard **exempted the current day**, which is
how a truncated 813 overwrote a genuine 11,107; and the missed-push
sentinel only shouted at *missing* days, so a stale midday partial sat
there in silence all morning. All three are fixed, and his locked-phone
test is what proved the first — automation fired, Mac awake and serving,
nothing arrived on either channel.

The fix that shipped is a clone, not a build. Six attempts at authoring a
`.shortcut` file failed on Shortcuts' own serialization (Statistics needs
an explicit input; hand-built date filters are inert) — each one costing
him an import and a run. What worked first time was fetching **his own
automation from an iCloud share link** and changing exactly two things:
the date token → the literal word `yesterday` (the server resolves it),
and the drop filename. Verified live: the full 8-metric payload filed
against 11 Aug, with the MAX fold and monotonic guard correctly keeping
his higher manual figure while every other metric repaired the day.

Two things were corrected rather than added. I wrote 11,107 back into
11 Aug from the pushlog without checking the window it was captured over —
it spanned midday-to-midday across two days and was never a valid daily
total; his manual 10,218 was right and mine was wrong. And I proposed a
fixed 22:30 push as a fix, which he correctly rejected: his bedtime
varies, so a fixed hour truncates the day unpredictably. Alarm-stop is the
only trigger that is both unlocked and after the day is complete.

### 10–12 August 2026
Nova learned to watch. The `/watch` skill became an agent — the Watcher —
and then a whole pipeline: a link in, transcript pulled locally, and either
a quick verdict (the Coach auditing a fitness video's claims against the
literature) or the full second-brain weave (Source, Concept, Entity and
Topic pages, wikilinked, verbatim transcript in `Raw/`). It ships with two
buttons because absorption costs ~$6 and triage costs ~$0.50, and he should
not pay the former to discover a video was filler.

Almost everything of value came from the failures, not the build. His first
real video — a 4-hour Hormozi podcast, 575k characters — broke the pipeline
four separate ways in sequence, and each break was a real bug: a budget cap
set by guess rather than measurement (a 150k chunk on the default Opus model
cost $1.46 against a $0.75 cap and died having written 218 tokens); a
2000-word payload wrapped in a JSON string that one raw newline destroyed;
an error handler that read stderr before stdout and so reported a harmless
"no stdin data" warning as the cause of a fifteen-minute failure; and the
weave itself dying at its own $8 cap on Opus. Measuring instead of guessing
fixed all of it — 60k chunks on Sonnet cost $0.35 and return 7k tokens of
dense notes — and the digest is now cached per video id so a retry never
re-pays. His question "will this duplicate anything?" was asked at exactly
the right moment: it would have, twice over, and video identity (by ID, not
URL) now prevents it.

Three things were corrected rather than added. The Watcher's first filing
put its note in `Wiki/Inbox` with `type: raw` and threw the transcript away,
so it never appeared under his Sources filter — it now writes his own
podcast convention. Four modules resolved a ghost `Claude%20Projects`
directory because the repo path contains a space (`URL.pathname` instead of
`fileURLToPath`), silently stranding a transcript and emptying the stream
feed's heartbeat reads. And ready ingest jobs lived only in memory, so a
$6 diff died on a server restart and had to be applied out-of-band — they
persist to disk now, drilled with a real `launchctl kickstart`. The 4-hour
conversation is in the vault: 41 changes, 19 new concepts, 11 existing
pages deepened rather than forked.

### 7–9 August 2026
The session split in two. First, a long Shortcuts saga: Ask Nova and Tell
Nova failed for hours through five different causes — a stale POST body, a
missing `text` field, a literal "Provided Input" placeholder, a colon in the
auth header (my documentation's fault), and finally requests that never left
the phone. Fixing it properly meant adding request receipts to the server,
binding the tailnet IP directly, and cutting a spoken answer from 26s to 12s
by caching CalDAV reads and parallelising the ask context. The health-push
root cause was also found and closed — the Shortcut's Request Body, not its
queries — though the automation has since stopped firing again for two
nights, which is HIS to check.

Second, the build wave: reminders (with real Apple Reminders alarms),
proactive Telegram, open loops, the fuel scorecard, Ambient v2, the widget
endpoint, the Ops tap-through (delegated to a subagent), the health mirror,
the pattern scout, the About You interview, and the distiller. The turn that
mattered most came from reading the data rather than the backlog: 30 days of
receipts showed Nova produced ~154 drafts and he kept 9, with the flagship
briefs aging out unread. That produced the trust ladder — autonomy computed
from real history and proposed on the rails — whose first pass filed three
proposals that are still waiting. Two things were corrected rather than
added: Nova was inventing macros for "I ate dinner" instead of marking the
planned meal, and a distill record was silently clobbered by writing to the
inbox store from a second process (now in DO NOT, with an in-process
endpoint as the fix).


### 3–4 August 2026
Customisability. Fixed the bug in his screenshot — an ingredients-only tweak
could not be saved because the alternate validator demanded a method it was
never going to have. Made a follow-up refine the version on screen instead of
restarting from the stored recipe, and put a mic beside the ask box so the
whole exchange can be spoken, with the answer read back from the preview
only. Built `editRecipe`: ingredients, method and macros, on any recipe or
any variant, reachable from ✎ EDIT THIS MEAL.

Two things were corrected rather than added. The first cut of the section
writer passed every test while drifting his file — it ate a blank line
between a recipe's `---` and the next heading, and stripped the bold from
steps he never touched; the identity round-trip over his real collection is
what caught it, and the writer now rewrites only the lines that changed.
Second, I spent three rounds chasing a wiring bug that did not exist: the
edit button was absent from the running app only because Vite was serving a
cached module. Both are now in DO NOT. The overnight push also fired a
second consecutive night (12,619 steps filed for 3 Aug), so that criterion
moved from one data point to two.

### 3 August 2026
Closed the steps saga: first fully automatic overnight push landed
(8,295 for 2 Aug). Verified the pmset changes he ran. Corrected my own
diagnosis — both the sleeping Mac *and* a non-firing phone automation were
real, on different nights. Made a sleeping Mac survivable: added this week's
four screens to the offline cache and made "mark meal eaten" queue via the
Outbox. Answered the hosting question (frontend already on Pages; backend
cannot move to serverless). Established this handoff system.

### 2 August 2026
NovaBar diagnosed and fixed (empty icon image, unplaceable status item,
off-screen panel) — it now opens on launch and via ⌥Space. Phone dock made
symmetrical: three each side of the core, Train and Recipes in the default
slots, plus a FREQUENT row in the More sheet. Spread view transitions to
notes/routines/sessions and gave every clickable press physics.

### 1–2 August 2026
Presence, motion and latency: NovaBar built (Swift, no Xcode project),
shared-element transitions on recipes, instant spoken acknowledgement to fill
the 5–8s think gap, CountUp numbers. Topic Pulse shipped. Describe-it food
logging shipped. Recipe promote-duplication bug fixed and his vault repaired.
Variant rename, in-session exercise skip, Coach skip-awareness.

### 30–31 July 2026
Companion Phases 3–5 (voice-confirmed actions, references/research, rituals),
the doorman greetings, skill registry, Nova Operations screen, overnight
queue, Telegram bridge, ambient wall mode, inbox expiry, and the food-log
write-race fix.
